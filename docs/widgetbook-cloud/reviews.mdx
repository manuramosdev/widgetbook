# Widgetbook Cloud Review

<Warning>
  Widgetbook Cloud Review currently works with **GitHub only**. We are planning
  to add more Git providers in the future.
</Warning>

Widgetbook Cloud Review has two main features that can help you improve your development workflow:

1. [**UI Regression Detection**](/widgetbook-cloud/reviews#ui-regression-detection): to automatically detect UI regressions.
1. [**Figma x Flutter Comparison**](/widgetbook-cloud/reviews#figma-x-flutter-comparison): to verify if the developer meets the design requirements.

## Pre-requisites

1. **Connect** your Widgetbook Project to a **GitHub repo** from the project settings page.
1. Make sure you have a [Widgetbook Build](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting) on pushes of new commits [via CI](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting#pushing-new-builds-with-ci) (e.g. GitHub Actions).

## UI Regression Detection

Widgetbook Cloud provides a zero-config UI regression detection system. It automatically compares the visual differences between different builds and highlights the changes in the UI.

It works similarly like GitHub PRs. Instead of only comparing code changes, with Widgetbook Cloud Reviews, you can now also compare visual differences and detect **UI regressions** between different branches or commits.

| GitHub PRs                                                       | Widgetbook Cloud Reviews                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compare **code changes** between `base` commit and `head` commit | Compare **visual differences** between `base` build and `head` build |

### Guide

1. Finish the [pre-requisites](/widgetbook-cloud/reviews#pre-requisites) set up.
1. Create a new branch (e.g. `feat/new-button`) and commit your changes to it.
1. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your `head` branch (e.g. `feat/new-button`) to the `base` branch (e.g. `main`).
1. After your build upload finishes (i.e. the CI job from [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)), a [commit status](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) will be added to your PR once the review is ready.

### Reviewing

After your review is ready, you can start comparing the visual differences between the `base` and `head` builds. Here are some things that can help improving your workflow:

1. **Validate** if your visual changes are intentional or not.
2. **Ask team mates for review** if all changes were intentional.
3. **Provide feedback** by copying the link to the Widgetbook Cloud Review Story and leaving a comment in the GitHub PR.

<Info>
  If the reviewer doesn't have access to GitHub _(e.g. a designer)_, we suggest
  using messaging tools _(e.g. Slack)_. Please [reach
  out](https://discord.com/invite/zT4AMStAJA) to us in case this doesn't suit
  you and you want to use a dedicated comment feature in Widgetbook Cloud.

### Review Statuses

| Status | Description                                         |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Open   | Awaiting assessment.                                |
| Merged | Linked with merged PRs, thus considered merged.     |
| Closed | Associated with closed PRs, hence viewed as closed. |

## Figma x Flutter Comparison

Widgetbook Cloud Review can also help with verifying if the developer meets the **design requirements** by comparing the **Flutter widgets** to their corresponding **Figma designs**.

### Guide

To have a "View in Figma" button in your reviews, you need to add the Figma URL to your use-cases:

1. In your Figma design file, navigate to the component that resembles your Widget.
1. Copy the link to the component by right-mouse clicking on the component and selecting `Copy/Paste as` > `Copy Link`.
1. Set the `designLink` property of the `@UseCase` annotation by pasting the copied link.

   ```dart
   // Example from https://github.com/widgetbook/groceries-demo/blob/main/widgetbook/lib/core/app_bar.dart
   @UseCase(
     designLink: 'https://www.figma.com/file/EXuEpwiyksLAejYX1qr1v4/Fluttercon-Berlin-2023-Demo?type=design&node-id=277-3056&mode=design&t=nVL8hLmc1jlcilZL-4',
     name: 'Default',
     type: AppBar
   )
   ```

1. Re-run `build_runner` to update the use-cases metadata.

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

1. Commit your changes and push them to your repository; to create a new build.

## Limitations

### Animations

If your use-cases have any animations (e.g. `CircularProgressIndication`), then the visual comparison might not work as expected. This is because the visual comparison algorithm is not able to compare animations.

We suggest using one of the following workarounds:

1. **Adaptive animations**: you might want to still enjoy your animations while running Widgetbook, but you just need to disable them when the use-case is being used in a Widgetbook-Cloud-context. To do so, you can use the following `extension`, to make your use-cases adaptive to the Widgetbook Cloud Reviews and disable the animations during the visual comparison.

   ```dart
   extension WidgetbookContext on BuildContext {
     /// The `preview` query parameter is used while taking snapshots of the
     /// use-case for Widgetbook Cloud Reviews. This getter can be used to
     /// customize the behavior of the use-case while taking the snapshots,
     /// it can be used to disable animations for example.
     bool get isInWidgetbookCloud => WidgetbookState.of(this).previewMode;
   }

   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: CircularProgressIndicator)
   Widget adaptiveAnimationUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return CircularProgressIndicator(
       value: context.isInWidgetbookCloud ? 0.5 : null,
     );
   }
   ```

1. **Starting animations on-demand**: you can use a `boolean` knob to start your animations. This way, you can disable the animations during the visual comparison but you can still see the animations in the Widgetbook.

   ```dart
   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: CircularProgressIndicator)
   Widget onDemandAnimationUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return CircularProgressIndicator(
       value: context.knobs.boolean(label: 'Static') ? 0.5 : null,
     );
   }
   ```

### Random values

If your use-case displays random values (e.g. dates), that can be different across different builds, the visual comparison might not work as expected.

We suggest using one of the following workarounds:

1. Use a **constant value** for the random value.

   ```diff
   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: Text)
   Widget constantValueUseCase(BuildContext context) {
   -  return Text(Random().nextInt(10).toString());
   +  return Text('10');
   }
   ```

1. Use [**Knobs**](/knobs/overview) with a default value.

   ```diff
   @UseCase(name: 'Default', type: Text)
   Widget constantValueUseCase(BuildContext context) {
   -  return Text(Random().nextInt(10).toString());
   +  return Text(
   +    context.knobs.string(label: 'value', defaultValue: '10'),
   +  );
   }
   ```
